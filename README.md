## Earthquake Visualization Using Leaflet
 In this challenge, I have been tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data for earthquakes that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

## File Locations
The  code is inside the LeafletPart1/ static / js folder.
The screenshots of the output can be found in the screenshot folder.
